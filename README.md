# Build-Godot-cpp
This program creates the entire cpp framework for godot.

### Command Usage / Variation:
```
.\script.ps1 <project name> --disable-script-files --disable-gd-files
```

If you can't run the script because of the digital signature, create a new file ```script.ps1``` and paste its contents into it. Then run the setup as above.

If you cannot execute scripts at all, run ```Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned``` in PowerShell as an administrator. Then type ```y``` or ```A``` and confirm.
